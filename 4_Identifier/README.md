# 2. How Python Works?

- An identifier is a name having a few letters, numbers and special characters `_` (underscore). 
- It should always start with a non-numeric character. 
- It is used to identify a variable, function, symbolic constant, class etc. 
- Ex : - 
    - X2
    - PI
    - Sigma
    - matadd
    - full_name
- Python is case sensitive programming language.
    - d is not equal to D
    - t is not equal to T
    - rahul is not equal to Rahul
    - rahul is not eqaul to RAHUL
