# Indentation

- Indentation refers to spaces that are used in the beginning of a statement. By default python puts 4 spaces but it can be changed by programmers.

```python
if (condition):
____Statement
____if(condition):
________statement 1
________statement 2
____if(condition):
________Statement
if(condition):
____Statement 1
____Statement 2 
Rest of the code
