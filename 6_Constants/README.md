# 6. Constants

- A constant is an identifier whose value cannot be changed throughout the execution of a program whereas the variable value keeps on changing.
- There are no constants in Python, the way they exist in C and Java. 
- In Python, It is not possible to define constant whose value can not be changed.
- In Python, Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words but remember its value can be changed.
- Ex:- 
    - PI
    - TOTAL
    - MIN_VALUE

Code:-
```python
PI = 3.14
print(PI)
```
Output:
```bash
3.14
```
